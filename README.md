# Creating-GIFs-with-OpenCV
In this project you can learn how to create animated GIFs using OpenCV, Python, and ImageMagick.

To keep the post lighthearted and fun, we learned how to use OpenCV to generate GIFs of the “Deal With It” meme, a popular meme (and also my personal favorite) that can be found in some capacity on nearly every social media website.

In order to build our meme generator, we leveraged computer vision and deep learning in a number of practical ways, including:

    *Face detection
    *Facial landmark prediction
    *Extracting regions of the face (in this case, the eyes)
    *Computing the angle between the eyes, a requirement for face alignment
    *Generating transparent overlays via alpha blending

Finally, we took our set of generated images and then created an animated GIF using OpenCV and ImageMagick.
